### PROJECT TITLE: Femail - Parking Management System

### PROJECT SCOPE:
Now a day’s most of the parking areas are manually managed or hand-operated by staff and there is no automated system to manage parking effectively. So, the Vehicles parking management system will play an important role to reduce traffic in the city by efficiently managing vehicle parking. In addition, this type of system will reduce manual labor and save time. Such a system can be used in a large, multi-story or multilevel building.

### TECHNOLOGIES:
-- JAVA Programming Language

-- ORACLE Database

### PROJECT ABSTRACT:

Our main goal is to create a fully automated Vehicle’s parking system with minimal human interference. In the context of the present age, it is said that we do not have time. In our daily life, we are often in the office, on the street, in the mall, everywhere, only the problem, and that is the parking problem. Because of illegal parking, we have to deal with extreme stress every day. And we all know how much time is wasted on this tragedy. And that's why we have to plan this system. We hope that our ideas will be different and more complete than others. Because, we've seen in existing systems sometimes accidents can happen in parking situations. In our project we propose a system that will provide a single point of access to the parking vacant space. This system has information regarding every vacant and occupied parking place.

### PROJECT FUNCTIONALITIES:

•	Record keeping of parked vehicles, in/out vehicles and also for parking tickets.

•	Revenue Calculation of parking tickets. 

•	Search for any vehicle.

•	Generation of tickets.

•	Allocation of parking slot according to type of vehicles. 

•	Information about the parking slot i.e., reserved or not.

•	Easy to use Interface for users (admin, staff member, clients etc.).
